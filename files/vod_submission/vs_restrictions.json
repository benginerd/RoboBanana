"description":"__**1. No Reyna.**__\nReyna is a feast or famine agent that lacks strong utility and Woohoojin's coaching does not rely on fragging to climb.

No Astra unless Immortal+.**__\nAstra is an incredibly complicated agent and relies too much on your teammates to be effective. Below Immortal, you are better off playing other Controllers."}
