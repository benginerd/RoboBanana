{"title":"**You must read all information in this channel. Failure to do so will result in a rejected VOD.**",
"description": "If you had a coach, would you rather they tell you things you already know, or blow your mind with information you never knew? Obviously, you want the new information. In order for Woohoojin to provide his insight, your VOD must display the fundamentals outlined in these requirements; it is a waste of time for both parties if VOD reviews only cover basic information that is already on YouTube. For example, Woohoojin cannot teach you anything useful if your VOD is of you staring at the floor for the entire match or you are not communicating enough with your team. \n\n**These requirements are preliminary coaching.** If you do not meet them, then there is no reason for Woohoojin to VOD review you. Apply these requirements to guarantee that you are playing at your very best, and THEN get the VOD review to take your skill even further. VODs that fail to meet these requirements are denied.\n\nThese requirements ensure that reviewed VODs are of players familiar with their agent and role to maximize learning potential. To submit a VOD, your rank must be Gold+. If you are below Gold, use this video instead. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KIoTtohkOQ"}
