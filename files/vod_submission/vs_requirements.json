"description": "__**1. No filling. You must main an agent and have experience with them.**__\nNot having a main limits your performance and VOD reviews are not basic agent guides. If you play too many agents, then you either do not have a main, or you do not have enough familiarity with them to deserve a review. Your Tracker history must clearly display a main agent that you play in the overwhelming majority of your matches and not show you filling often.\n\n__**2. Make pre-round plans.**__\n\nYou must attempt to coordinate plays with your team before the round starts for the entire match. Bad plans are better than no plans. \n\nExample of an acceptable plan: \"Phoenix, I'll put this cage up for you to flash out of if they push us.\"  \nExample of a low-effort plan that does not count: \"Let's all go to A.\" \n\nCommunicating with your duo in Discord instead of communicating with your team is not acceptable.\n\n__**3. Play consistently.**__\nUpon VOD submission, you must have played at least 1 Comp match per day for 11 of the last 14 days - a maximum of 3 days off over the last 2 weeks. Anything less is not consistent enough to ensure that your VOD is of your best gameplay with these requirements implemented and therefore it will be rejected.\n\n__**4. Read the rest of this channel.**__\nDo it."}
